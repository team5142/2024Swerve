/**
 * This interface lists all methods that must be implemented by specific motor controller implementation classes
 * These methods must be implemented in the Passthrough class (a "generic" class used by the code that 
 * chooses the right motor controller type based on the parameters in Constants), as well clases specific to the
 * implementation of the motor controller type (e.g. TalonSRX vs SPARK_MAX).
 * You should be able to use simulation classes here as well, as long as you expose their functionality via mehtods
 * listed in this interface.
 * 
 * The motor controler object will be created of the type of this interface, and will only contain the methods listed below.
 * That means all desired motor controller functionality must be expressed in these methods. If additional functionality
 * is desired, add abstact methods below, and provide their implementation in each of the hardware-specific
 * classes, as well as a Passthrough class, which should simply call an underlying implementation method.
